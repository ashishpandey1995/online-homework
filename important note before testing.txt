user can view evaluated score of answers any time but plagiarism can't be seen any time because to detect plag R script which is running in Azure will be required
text files. These txt files are automatically generated inside 'ansfiles' folder in host server. These txt files contains all submitted answers of student and for each student
 a text file will be generated named with username.txt. So before allowing students to see plagiarism you will have to download this ansfiles folder from host server then
 convert in zip then upload it into Azure ML. After successful uploading students can check their plag report.

Steps to upload ansfiles.zip in Azure:-
1)Open azure ml and sign in with account where R scripts are running.
2)Go to new and click on upload dataset, choose 'ansfiles.zip' from desktop.
3)Then it will ask is it a new version of existing dataset, click yes and upload.
4)At footer of azure there will be an option for deploy web service, click on it.

Changes in secondpage.html:-
go to this html page  and find view plag button then replace it's action by 'fetchplagscore.php'. (remove '#')

Now you have done.
